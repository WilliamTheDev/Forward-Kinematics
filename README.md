# What's forward kinematics?

Forward kinematics is the act of computing the end-effector from the parameters of each arm joint. By calculating this, we can precisely control the motion of the robotic arm in three-dimensional space.

# How to run it?

If you're only using the raw-data option, you shouldn't need to install any additional programs. But if you chose to run the robotic arm visualisation program. You will need to install vpython. 

Run the command below in your terminal

    $ python -m pip install vpython

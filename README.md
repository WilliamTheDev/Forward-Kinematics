A modular, customizable and easy-to-use 4-Axis forward-kinematic rig.

Lastest Verison: 0.10 (Beta)

# What's foward Kinematics?

Foward kinematics is the acting of computing the End-effector from the specified parameters of the joints. By calculating the End-effector, we are able to do highly accurate positioning of the robotic arm. 

# How to use?

If your only using the raw-data option, you shouldn't need to install any other programs. But if you chose to run the robotic arm visualisation program. You will need to install vpython. 

Run the command below in your terminal

    $ python -m pip install vpython
